### Forecasting Models to predict Stock Prices
Explanatory Stock Price Predictions
Stock markets have always been a fancy for companies, investors and traders. There is a plethora of investors investing or exiting the stocks at any point of time with different trading strategies and investment horizons. However the underlying objective of every type of investor is common "Maximize the returns and minimize the losses." To achieve this objective every investor is intrigued with one question â€œIs my stock price going to rise or fall in future".
People have been trying to find this answer from various angles. For some investors fundamentals are important and hence they rely on the fundamental strength of the stock. Others try to predict the movement of the stock based on technical analysis. Some try to predict the movement based on news about stocks and overall market sentiment while other tries to track the trend to predict the price of stock.
